# multi-cluster-configs

## Overview

This repository contains the GitOps configurations for managing multiple OpenShift clusters. It uses a combination of Kustomize and ArgoCD (via the OpenShift GitOps Operator) to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of various applications and services across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **`oc` CLI:** The OpenShift Command-line Interface.
- **`kustomize`:** A tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations.
- **`git`:** For version control.
- **Cluster Access:** Appropriate permissions to the target OpenShift cluster.
- **Secrets:** Necessary secrets configured for ArgoCD to access the Git repository and for the External Secrets Operator to access the secret store.

## Top level directories:

* bootstrap: Contains configuration for bootstrapping the GitOps System.
* cluster-configs/base: Components that need to be installed or configured in the cluster.
* cluster-configs/overlay: Selects components to be installed into the cluster.
* tools : Helper scripts (e.g. setting up CI for gitlab & linting ).

### GitOps Resources:
* [What is GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/)
* [App of Apps pattern](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/)
* [Red Hat CoP GitOps Catalog](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog): A collection of curated GitOps patterns and examples.
  
### Bootstrap process:

Configuring a new cluster (e.g. the `dev` cluster) requires executing the following commands.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON SECRETS** ðŸš¨

Before proceeding, ensure you have created the necessary Kubernetes secrets with the correct permissions for:
- **ArgoCD (GitOps)**: To access the Git repository.
- **External Secrets Operator**: To authenticate with your chosen secret store (e.g., Vault, GitLab, etc.).

These are critical prerequisites for the bootstrap process to succeed.

1. **Install the OpenShift GitOps Operator**

The OpenShift GitOps Operator is the foundation of our GitOps setup. It installs and manages ArgoCD on the cluster.
```
kustomize build bootstrap/overlays/dev/gitops-operator | oc apply -f - 
```

2. **Install the External Secrets Operator**

The External Secrets Operator is used to fetch secrets from a secret store (like Vault or Gitlab) and create Kubernetes secrets from them. This allows us to keep sensitive data out of Git repository.

```bash
kustomize build bootstrap/overlays/dev/external-secrets-operator | oc apply -f -
``` 

3. **App of Apps Pattern is executed**

Once these bootstrap components are installed, the `appofapp.yaml` in `bootstrap/overlays/dev/gitops-operator` will deploy the cluster configurations defined in `cluster-configs`.
