# Multi-Cluster Kubernetes GitOps Repository

This repository follows GitOps principles for managing Kubernetes configurations across multiple clusters.

## Repository Structure

- **bootstrap/**: Initial cluster setup components (operators, ArgoCD)
  - `base/`: Core operator definitions and configurations
  - `overlays/`: Environment-specific customizations
- **cluster-configs/**: Application and infrastructure configurations
  - `base/`: Core Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
  - `overlays/`: Environment-specific patches and customizations
- **docs/**: Documentation and guidelines
- **tools/**: Utility scripts and tools

## Key Principles

1. **Declarative Configuration**: All infrastructure and application state is defined declaratively in YAML
2. **Kustomize Structure**: Follow base/overlays pattern for environment-specific customizations
3. **Security First**: Use ExternalSecrets for all sensitive data, never commit secrets directly
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Changes are made through Git commits, not direct cluster modifications

## Environment Overlays

- `dev/`: Development environment configurations
- `prod/`: Production environment configurations (when present)

All changes to cluster state must be made through this Git repository.
