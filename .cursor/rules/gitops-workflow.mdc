# GitOps Workflow Guidelines

## Core Principle
**The Git repository is the single source of truth for cluster state.**

## Making Changes

### 1. Declarative Changes Only
- All cluster modifications must be made through YAML commits
- No imperative `kubectl` commands for permanent changes
- No manual cluster modifications

### 2. Change Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Make declarative changes to YAML files
3. Test changes in development environment first
4. Submit pull request for review
5. Merge to main branch
6. ArgoCD automatically applies changes

### 3. Environment Promotion
- **Development First**: Test all changes in `overlays/dev/` first
- **Production**: Apply to production overlays only after dev validation
- **Rollback**: Use Git revert for quick rollbacks

### 4. Operator Management
- Use `Subscription` resources for operator lifecycle
- Pin operator versions in production overlays
- Use appropriate update channels (`stable`, `fast`, etc.)

### 5. Application Deployment
- Applications are managed through ArgoCD Applications
- Follow the app-of-apps pattern for organization
- Use Helm charts where appropriate with proper values files

## File Organization
- Keep related resources together in logical directories
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Maintain separation between base and overlay configurations
- Document complex configurations in README.md files

## Validation
- Ensure YAML syntax is correct
- Validate Kubernetes resource schemas
- Test in development before production deployment
- Use ArgoCD sync policies appropriately

**Remember**: Every change goes through Git → ArgoCD → Cluster
